## Week 2

### Products & TEACHING AND LEARNING RESOURCES
This week I centered my lesson on the cloud computing infrastructure through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and content management through Joomla CMS. Here, I used GCP documents as well as video tutorials to learn about cloud infrastructure. In regards to Joomla, I read through the documentation provided by their official website and information from forums.
Key learning resources included:

-  Documentation of Google Cloud Platform
-  Joomla Official Documentation
-  Online tutorials on infrastructural setup in google cloud platform (GCP) instance
-  Online discussions with regard to Joomla templating and modules

### Estimated Hours

-  GCP Infrastructure setup and learning: 4 hours
-  Joomla CMS installation and configuration: 3 hours
-  Template customization and module implementation: 3 hours
#### Total: 10 hours

### Content Insights
While using GCP I have gained a lot of knowledge as to how one manages infrastructure in the cloud. I learned how to:

-  Install a VM instance which is running the cloud on GCP
-  Implement the right firewall policies for firewall access
-  Deal with the cloud storage and databases
-  Setup a web server that will enable the running of Joomla

With Joomla CMS, I discovered its robust content management capabilities:

That is why it is necessary to additionally create a user-friendly administrative interface.
-  A large number of options for adjusting templates
-  Application extension system
-  The integration of SEO tool and menu navigation

The integration of GCP and Joomla taught me about:

-  Some of the host requirements for CMS hosting servers
-  Configuration management of databases in cloud platform.
-  Domain mapping and httpsérience acquisition
-  CMS architecture hosted in the cloud with an important focus on the performance aspect.

### Work/Job/Training and Development Opportunities
I have gained an invaluable experience in analyzing the cloud infrastructure and the content management systems which are in high demand in the current world. From the market analysis, I have found that organizations are migrating their infrastructure to cloud providers such as GCP, thus, these lessons are relevant.
When it comes to working with Joomla it can be noted that CMS platforms are very crucial to web development professionals. It is a helpful ability to many organizations that look for individuals who are capable of handling and implementing different types of CMS solutions.

### Challenges and Future Learning:

-  There is always the need to fathom more about the extent of the GCP advanced security features.
-  Enrich the work on Joomla’s extension development
-  Read more about how CMS applications can be scaled in the cloud.

### Moving forward, I plan to:

-  Get certified for GCP so as to support my experience in cloud computing.
-  Design my own custom joomla templates, as to improve my content management systems proficiency.
-  Discover possibilities of cooperation between GCP services and CMS platforms
