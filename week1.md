# Learning-Journal

Week 1

Learning Activities & Resources

This week I develped a simple website for Ecogrow an organization that focuses on healthier horticulture and food production. I studied how the website is organized and its overall structure. I learnt a refresher on the website building blocks including html and bootstrap for styling. I used W3 schools to understand the basics of HTML and CSS



Estimated Hours

I spent about 5hrs of my time this week understanding the overview and what is expected of me during this course.

Content Insights

During the week 1 practical, I spent most of my time understanding bootstrap which would come in handy during the development of my website. I got an understanding of how the bootstrap classes work and how they can be used with HTML. During this week I developed a static web with just a frontend which probed me to think how to intergrate the backend of the site.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After developing my simple website in Pract 1, I was proud of my achievement and was excited to find out whether with skills I have gained I can get a job description that matches my skills. After going through seek and seeing the related jobs adverstised, I realised HTML and CSS are not enough to meet the market demand. I therefore came up with strategies to advance my skills in web development. This includes advancing in Javascript and php for the backend.
