## Learning Activities and resources
This week I focused on the process of creating and launching a WordPress site on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It was important for me to clarify the key differences
between the cloud-based hosting methodology and the typical shared-hosting concept. To get familiar with the platform I initially read through the official documentation 
that GCP offers on its services and guidelines for hosting applications on the cloud.
Besides I read several methods and procedures on how to create a virtual machine instance on GCP, configure the instance for WordPress, and get the website live,
I have also taken my time to watch several comprehensive youtube videos on the same subject. Out of all the information presented, I found these visual guides more
useful while learning about the GCP console after organizing the resources by navigating through the console and learning about the process of deploying a web server.

## Estimated Hours
I dedicated approximately 8 hours this week to learning about GCP, setting up WordPress, and successfully deploying my first site.

## Content Insights
What I found most enlightening during this week’s practical was the information on cloud computing and web hosting. During this part, I learned about the cloud environment
and the mechanisms of one of the first servers – a virtual machine on the GCP. It was important to understand how to connect to the instance via Secure Shell given the login credentials
and learn how to install applications or packages such as Apache, MySQL, PHP Applications or AMP, LAP etc., for the WordPress installation. As compared to shared hosting setup,
the configuration of WordPress on cloud platform was comparatively difficult but it helped me to learn about the working of web based applications. I also learned about security
in cloud environments, for example, when learning about firewalls, and the concept of least privilege when creating database users.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Once I deployed my WordPress site onto GCP, I searched for some job postings regarding cloud computing and WordPress. Thus, I realized that most organizations are looking for
people with prior experience in cloud services such as the GCP, AWS, or Azure. It was this realization that has made me consider to learn more about cloud services and even sit for 
the cloud computing certifications. Also, I discovered that although WordPress development skills are highly sought after, most job offers also involve custom theme and plugin development.
In order to increase my marketability, I propose to expand my skills in PHP and work with using complex WordPress development.
